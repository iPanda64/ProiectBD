## Prerequisites

-   JDK 17 or later
-   Apache Maven
-   MySQL Server 8.0+ (ensure it is running and accessible)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iPanda64/platforma-studiu.git
   cd platforma-studiu
   ```

2. **Set up the MySQL database**
   - Start your MySQL server.
   - Log into MySQL:
     ```bash
     mysql -u root -p
     ```
   - Create the database used by the project:
     ```sql
     CREATE DATABASE platforma_studiu;
     ```
   - Import the provided SQL file (located in the project root) to create tables and insert initial data:
     ```bash
     mysql -u root -p platforma_studiu < platforma-studiu-dump.sql
     ```

3. **Database configuration**
   - The project is preconfigured to connect to MySQL using:
     ```
     URL: jdbc:mysql://127.0.0.1:3306/platforma_studiu
     Username: root
     Password: root
     ```
   - Ensure your MySQL server is running locally and that these credentials are valid.  
  - If you need to change them, edit the following file:
     ```
     platforma-studiu/src/PlatformaStudiu/Query.java
     ```
     Update the `url`, `uid`, and `pw` variables with your own database details.

4. **Build and run the project**
   ```bash
   mvn clean javafx:run
## Default Login Credentials

For testing or initial use, you can log in with the following accounts:

## Display Recommendation

- For the best visual experience, set your Windows display scaling to **125%**.  
- Use a screen with a **16:10 aspect ratio** if possible.  
- This ensures all JavaFX UI elements are displayed correctly.
